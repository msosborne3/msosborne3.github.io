I decided to build a to-do application for my final project. I realize that to do lists are sort of overdone, but I saw it as a fun and useful challenge. Lately my life has been really hectic and to-do lists are extremely helpful. Also it seemed like a great project to write and connect a Rails API that allows for CRUD actions. A user can create a new list, add items to the list, and mark items as done by crossing them off.

A really big and exciting part of this project was writing the Rails API and connecting it to the React Application. However, this sounded a lot more intimidating than it actually was due to a lot of help from some really great blog posts!

The biggest struggle that I ran into while developing this project was dealing with the react router. The router proved to be pretty complicated because I made a mistake early on in the development of my React app by including a render method in my App component, which is stateless. I didn’t even realize at the time that I had done that and I spent days trying to figure out why the URL would work but links wouldn’t. Thanks to help from a Learn instructor, I was able to fix that and finally the links worked! It’s pretty frustrating getting stumped for days from one line of code, but that’s why it’s extra important to be careful and observant initially.

Overall, I really enjoyed this project and I feel like I learned a ton! I created my own API, created my own React Application, learned to connect the two servers and learned to make calls from the React app to the Rails API. I now feel really confident that I can tackle more complicated project, and I’m so ready!
