Have you ever wanted to do something so badly, but you just can’t find the time? That is my struggle with bootcamp right now.

Between working a full time job and going to school full time, there just never seems to be enough time to get my school work done AND get my bootcamp lessons done when I’m not working. Ironically, the bootcamp is the one on which I wish I could focus 110% of my time and energy, but it is the thing that gets pushed to the back every time. Sadly, I am still struggling with this issue, but I have found three things that help me to use my time better.

### 1.	Make a calendar

I am definitely the type of person who loves checklists. I just love to see the *huge* list of things I need to do and then slowly watch the list get shorter and shorter as I cross tasks off.  That’s why a calendar is so helpful for me. I’ve found that if I write out every big thing that I have for a day (work, school, bootcamp, etc.…), I am so much more likely to stay on track and actually accomplish most of the goals I have set for the day. Seeing exactly what you need to do can show you that you really might not have as much as you thought, and it helps to get rid of that “oh my gosh I have too much to do so maybe I shouldn’t do anything” feeling.

### 2.	Get excited

Let yourself get excited about the things that interest you – things that at one point you were interested enough in to try and shove into your already busy schedule. If you allow yourself to feel excited about your tasks rather than dread them, they wont feel so much like tasks. Instead, when you get to work on them, it will seem like you FINALLY get to spend time on something fun.

### 3.	Tell everyone what you’re doing – *and be clear*

The biggest problem that I have with school and working is that my family has a hard time understanding that when I’m home from work, I’m not actually home - I’m still working. Unless I clearly tell them that I have homework due very soon or else leave home to do my schoolwork, I won’t find silence for even a moment. Try sharing your calendar with your friends and family and try getting them excited with you so that they want to *encourage* you and want to make sure they don’t *distract* you.
