Today I finished my Rails final project and I am extremely happy with the results! The best part of programming this project was that I actually felt confident in what I was doing. Yes, I had to reference how to do some stuff and yes, google was my friend, but that is not a bad thing. It feels amazing that I was able to know exactly what I wanted to make, how I wanted to make it, and that I knew enough to ask the right questions and get it done.

Lately I have been pretty into working out and just generally trying to be healthier, so I decided to make a fitness tracker for my project. The app is basically a place where you can record your meals and information about them as well as your workouts. So lets get into the nitty gritty...

## Behind the scenes

The very first thing that I did for this project was to make a notes file where I wrote down exactly what I was planning to do with my app: what models would be included, how they were associated to each other, what attributes each model needed, etc. I feel like this intense planning step is definitely what helped this process to be so successful. There was no guesswork as I was programming. At first, I did consider adding a social component to the program, but eventually I decided that that wouldn't be necessary so I didn't, but maybe in the future I will add it.

I obviously used Rails to complete this project. Honestly, one of the trickiest parts was figuring out how to properly set up a new Rails app and include the right gems because in most labs this is already done for us. Luckily, Rails has a really handy guide to pretty much everything you could ever need to know!

Next, I used Devise to create a user model with the ability to sign up, sign in, sign out, and more. Honestly, Devise is so awesome and saved me a whole lot of trouble! I also used Omniauth to allow users to sign in with Facebook. I find it extremely interesting to see how that works, but it is very complicated and is probably something I will have to reference for a while.

After getting the user set up, I went to work creating my models, migrations, and controllers. These were all pretty straightforward and not too tricky. There was a bit of a frustrating point where everything was going wrong and I could not find the problem, until finally I realized that I just wasn't saving a workout to the database... but once I overcame that, most things went pretty smoothly!

Finally, I added a little bit of CSS and wrapped it up. I'm really happy with the way that the app turned out, and I'm excited to build on the knowledge that I have learned in the Rails section!
