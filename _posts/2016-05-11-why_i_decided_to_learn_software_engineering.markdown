**What do you want to be when you grow up?**

Every child has their own answer to this question, but, when I was a kid, my answer wasn't "A Software Engineer!" Most kids, myself included, aspire to be Doctors, Lawyers, Popstars, and Princesses. It wasn't until I was about to graduate high school that I truly considered Computer Science, and it wasn't until my first semester of college that I actually decided that this is what I want to do.

I went into my Freshman year with a major in Chemical Engineering, and within the first semester I knew that it wasn't for me. However, that semester taught me a lot. I was already in most of the beginner Engineering classes including one class that mostly taught Excel and MATLAB, so I got a little taste of programming. It sparked my curiosity and I decided to look into coding. I found Codecadamy and did several of their coding tracks and fell in love. I decided to change my major to Computer Science and dive more into programming!

Two years later I am still in love with programming! However, during the two years that I was doing Computer Science, I felt very stalled. I didn't feel like I was learning enough in school and I just craved more information and more coding experience. This led me to continue with Codecadamy and do anything I could to learn more about programming. I was very interested in coding bootcamps and wished more than anything that I could go visit one of the major tech hubs and participate in one, but finally, I found the Learn Verified program by The Flatiron School - an incredible remote bootcamp that taught the same skills online that it teaches in person! I decided to take a chance and apply. A few days later I was accepted and have been loving it ever since.
